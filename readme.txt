Professional dark mode for WordPress with smart scheduling, multiple themes, and customization options.

== Description ==

Nightly adds a professional dark mode to your WordPress site with one click. Give your visitors a comfortable viewing experience with automatic dark mode that reduces eye strain and saves battery life.

= Why Dark Mode? =

Dark mode reduces eye strain during nighttime browsing and in low-light environments. Studies show 68% of users prefer dark mode for evening use. It also saves battery life on OLED screens and provides a modern, professional look.

= How It Works =

Nightly uses smart CSS filters to automatically invert your site's colors when dark mode is active. Your visitors can toggle between light and dark modes using a floating button, or you can set automatic scheduling based on time of day.

**6 Color Themes**
Choose from Classic, Cool, Warm, High Contrast, Pure Black (OLED), or create your own custom colors.

**Smart Auto-Scheduling**
Automatically enable dark mode during evening hours (e.g., 8 PM to 6 AM).

**Customizable Toggle Button**
3 styles (Classic, Pill, Minimal) with 5 size options that float on your site.

**Smooth Transitions**
Adjustable fade animations when switching between light and dark modes.

**Keyboard Shortcuts**
Let power users toggle dark mode with customizable keyboard shortcuts.

**Per-Page Control**
Disable dark mode on specific pages like landing pages or photo galleries.

Lightweight and fast with no impact on page speed.

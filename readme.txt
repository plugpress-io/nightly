Nightly Dark Mode customizable dark mode plugin for site that allows you to easily add a dark theme.

== Description ==

Nightly Dark Mode adds dark mode to your website in one click. Give visitors a more comfortable viewing experience with automatic dark mode that can help reduce eye strain. With customizable color schemes, scheduling options, and a floating toggle button, Nightly makes it easy to offer a dark theme for your site.

= Why Dark Mode? =

Dark mode makes your site more comfortable to browse in low light. Many users prefer it at night, and OLED screens may use less power with darker colors. It also gives your site a modern look.

= How It Works =

Nightly applies a smart CSS-based filter to create a dark version of your site when dark mode is enabled. Visitors can switch between light and dark using a floating toggle button, or you can enable automatic scheduling based on the time of day. The plugin also intelligently re-inverts images and media so they look correct in dark mode.

= Key Features =

**6 Color Themes**
Choose from Classic, Cool, Warm, High Contrast, Pure Black (OLED), or create your own custom colors.

**Smart Auto-Scheduling**
Automatically enable dark mode during evening hours (e.g., 8 PM to 6 AM).

**Customizable Toggle Button**
3 styles (Classic, Pill, Minimal) with 5 size options that float on your site.

**Smooth Transitions**
Adjustable fade animations when switching between light and dark modes.

**Keyboard Shortcuts**
Let power users toggle dark mode with customizable keyboard shortcuts.

**Per-Page Control**
Disable dark mode on specific pages, such as landing pages or photo galleries.

**Media Controls**
Individual brightness adjustments for images, videos, and backgrounds.

**Performance Optimized**
Lightweight and fast with no impact on page speed.
